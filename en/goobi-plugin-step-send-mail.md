## Introduction
This documentation describes the installation, configuration and use of the Step Plugin for sending emails within a task in Goobi workflow. The list of recipients and the text can be configured individually for different steps. All fields from the VariableReplacer are also available. This means that metadata or information on the task, step or project can also be accessed.


## Installation
The plugin consists in total of the following files to be installed:

```bash
plugin-intranda-step-sendMail-base.jar
plugin_intranda_step_sendMail.xml
```

The first file must be installed in the following directory:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/step/plugin-intranda-step-sendMail-base.jar
```

In addition, there is a configuration file that must be located in the following place:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/config/plugin_intranda_step_sendMail.xml
```


## Overview and functionality
The plugin is usually executed fully automatically within the workflow. It first determines whether there is a block in the configuration file that has been configured for the current workflow with regard to the project name and work step. If this is the case, the mail is generated and sent to the configured recipients.

This plugin is integrated into the workflow in such a way that it is executed automatically. Manual interaction with the plugin is not necessary. For use within a workflow step, it should be configured as shown in the screenshot below.

## Configuration
The configuration of the plugin is done via the configuration file `plugin_intranda_step_sendMail.xml` and can be adjusted during operation. The following is an example configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config_plugin>
    <!--
        order of configuration is:
        1.) project name and step name matches
        2.) step name matches and project is *
        3.) project name matches and step name is *
        4.) project name and step name are *
    -->
    <config>
        <!-- which projects to use for (can be more then one, otherwise use *) -->
        <project>*</project>
        <step>*</step>
        <!-- mail account -->
        <smtpUser>test@example.com</smtpUser>
        <smtpPassword>password</smtpPassword>

        <!-- server configuration -->
        <smtpServer>example.com</smtpServer>
        <smtpUseStartTls>false</smtpUseStartTls>
        <smtpUseSsl>true</smtpUseSsl>

        <!-- displayed sender address -->
        <smtpSenderAddress>do-not-reply@example.com</smtpSenderAddress>
        <!-- receiver, can be repeated -->
        <receiver>user@example.com</receiver>
        <receiver>second-user@example.com</receiver>

        <!-- message -->
        <messageSubject>subject text</messageSubject>
        <messageBody>body &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;with html&lt;/h1&gt;</messageBody>
    </config>
</config_plugin>
```
