## Introduction
This statistics plugin enables statistical recording of the activity of translators and editors who edit specific metadata fields within the METS file. In particular, the translation work in the metadata fields `Title (Arabic)`, `Title (English)`, `Description (English)` and `Description (Arabic)` is taken into account.


## Installation
To install the plugin, the following two files must be installed:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/statistics/plugin_intranda_statistics_sudan-base.jar
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/GUI/plugin_intranda_statistics_sudan-gui.jar
```

In addition, the following function must be created within the database:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS wordcount;

    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE FUNCTION wordcount(str TEXT CHARSET utf8mb4)
            RETURNS INT
            DETERMINISTIC
            SQL SECURITY INVOKER
            NO SQL
       BEGIN
         DECLARE wordCnt, idx, maxIdx INT DEFAULT 0;
         DECLARE currChar, prevChar BOOL DEFAULT 0;
         SET maxIdx=char_length(str);
         WHILE idx < maxIdx DO
             SET currChar=SUBSTRING(str, idx, 1) RLIKE '[[:alnum:]]';
             IF NOT prevChar AND currChar THEN
                 SET wordCnt=wordCnt+1;
             END IF;
             SET prevChar=currChar;
             SET idx=idx+1;
         END WHILE;
         RETURN wordCnt;
       END
     $$
     DELIMITER ;
```

A UTF8-encoded text can be passed to this function. The text is checked character by character. If the current character is an alnumeric character (letters, numbers, full stop, comma, letters with diacritics, brackets) but the previous character is not (nothing, space, newline, tab), a new word starts at this point and the word counter is incremented. At the end, the word counter is returned.


## Overview and functionality
To use this plugin, the user must have the correct role authorisation.

![Without correct authorisation, the plugin cannot be used](images/goobi-plugin-statistics-sudan-memory_screen1_en.png)

Therefore, please assign the role `view_translation_activity` to the group.

![Correctly assigned role fÃ¼r the users](images/goobi-plugin-statistics-sudan-memory_screen2_en.png)

Afterwards, the menu item `Translation and Editing Activity` can be selected in the section `Management`.

![Calling up the plugin in the menu](images/goobi-plugin-statistics-sudan-memory_screen3_en.png)

In order to limit the period of the evaluation, the two fields `Period from` and `Period to` can be used for the start date and end date. A date in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` can be entered here. Both entries are optional. If the start date is not filled in, the date on which the first step was completed applies. If the end date is missing, the current date is used.

![Selection of the period](images/goobi-plugin-statistics-sudan-memory_screen4_en.png)

In the `Unit` field, you define the time periods in which the evaluation is to be summarised. Here you can choose from the values `days`, `months`, `quarters` or `years`.

After specifying the required information, two different evaluations can be generated by this plugin:


### Evaluation: Overview
The evaluation `Overview` lists for each period within the start and end date which user has processed how many work steps `Translation of Arabic content to English` or `Translation of English content to Arabic`. It also shows how many words were entered in the fields `Title (Arabic)`, `Title (English)`, `Description (English)` and `Description (Arabic)` in these steps.


### Evaluation: Detailed View
The `Detailed View` lists each workflow step `Translation of Arabic content to English` or `Translation of English content to Arabic` that was completed within the specified start and end date. For each step, the user, the associated process, and the content and number of words from the four fields `Title (Arabic)`, `Title (English)`, `Description (English)` and `Description (Arabic)` are also displayed.

![Display of results with possibility for download](images/goobi-plugin-statistics-sudan-memory_screen5_en.png)

The two evaluations can also be downloaded as Excel files.
