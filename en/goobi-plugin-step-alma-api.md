  This plugin was originally implemented to communicate with ALMA and process returned responses. However, thanks to its general design, it can also be used to connect to other systems via REST.

## Introduction
This plugin is used to send requests to REST APIs, e.g. ALMA, and process the returned responses. Multiple commands can be configured to compile a complicated task. The plugin executes these commands one after the other in a defined order.


## Installation
To use the plugin, the file `plugin_intranda_step_alma_api-base.jar` must be saved in the following location:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/step/plugin_intranda_step_alma_api-base.jar
```

The configuration file `plugin_intranda_step_alma_api.xml` is expected under the following path:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/config/plugin_intranda_step_alma_api.xml
```


## Overview and functionality
This plugin is integrated into the workflow in such a way that it is executed automatically. Manual interaction with the plugin is not necessary. For use within a workflow step, it should be configured as shown in the screenshot below.

## Configuration
The configuration of the plugin is structured as follows as an example:

```xml
<config_plugin>
    <!--
        order of configuration is:
          1.) project name and step name matches
          2.) step name matches and project is *
          3.) project name matches and step name is *
          4.) project name and step name are *
	-->

        <!-- Variables that can be used for following commands.
              @name: name of the variable, e.g. VARIABLE. To use this variable's value, one can simply use {$VARIABLE}.
              @value: value to initialize this variable. It can be plain string value, or a Goobi variable, e.g. {meta.NAME} for a Metadata named NAME.
         -->
        <variable name="MMS_ID" value="{meta.CatalogIDDigital}" />
        <!-- There can be multiple variables defined before all commands. -->
        <variable name="SIGNATURE" value="{meta.shelfmarksource}" />

        <!-- A command is a step to perform. There can be several commands configured, and if so, they will be run one by one in the same order as they are defined.
              @method: get | put | post | patch
              @accept: json | xml. Used to set up the header parameter 'Accept'. OPTIONAL. DEFAULT json.
              @content-type: json | xml. Used to set up the header parameter 'Content-type'. OPTIONAL. DEFAULT json.
              @endpoint: raw endpoint string without replacing the placeholders enclosed by {}. For every placeholder say {PLACEHOLDER}, one has to configure it in a
                                sub-tag, and in our example it would be <PLACEHOLDER>. Options for values of these sub-tags are:
                                - plain text value
                                - any variable defined by a <variable> tag before all <command> blocks
                                - any variable defined by a <target> sub-tag of any previous <command> block

                      - random: get a random JSONObject related to the common heading path shared by filter and targets, and search for targets within it

            <!-- Set up request body. OPTIONAL.
                 @src: absolute path to the file whose contents shall be used as request body. OPTIONAL. It accepts one of the following both:
                          - a plain text value stating the absolute path
                          - a predefined variable containing the absolute path
                          ATTENTION: one can also use the absolute path of the folder containing this file here, in which case the content of the first file in that folder will be used.
                 @wrapper: wrappers separated by space that shall be wrapped around the content read from the file. ONLY applicable if @src is configured. OPTIONAL.
                                  The precise way of wrapping depends on the setting of @content-type of the command tag.
                                  For example, say one has wrapper configured as "wrapper1 wrapper2 wrapper3" then:
                                  - If @content-type="json", the file content will be wrapped as {wrapper1: {wrapper2: {wrapper3: {FILE_CONTENT}}}}
                                  - If @content-type="xml", the file content will be wrapped as <wrapper1><wrapper2><wrapper3>{FILE_CONTENT}</wrapper3></wrapper2></wrapper1>
                 @value: use a plain text value or a predefined variable instead of the content of a file. OPTIONAL. ATTENTION:
                              - to use a plain text value one has to assure that its format matches the configured @content-type correctly
                              - to use a variable one has to assure that the format of the variable's value matches the configured @content-type correctly

### General configurations
The plugin is configured as described here:

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `project` | This parameter defines which project the current block `<config>` should apply to. The name of the project is used here. This parameter can occur multiple times per `<config>` block. |
| `step` | This parameter controls which work steps the `<config>` block should apply to. The name of the work step is used here. This parameter can occur multiple times per `<config>` block. |
| `url` | The base URL of the REST API is specified here. |
| `api-key` | The API key for the connection to the REST API is configured here. |
| `variable` | This tag can be used to define a variable that can be used by all subsequent commands. This tag has two attributes, where `@name` defines the name and `@value` the value. `@value` expects a simple text value or a Goobi variable. |
| `command` | A command block defines a command that is to be executed in the job. It has two mandatory attributes itself, where `@method` specifies the method to be used and `@endpoint` specifies the path to the endpoint, where all placeholders are not replaced. It also has two optional attributes, `@accept` and `@content-type`, which are used to specify the request parameters `accept` and `content-type`. Both expect either `json` or `xml`. If one of the two parameters is omitted, the default value `json` is used. Further details can be found in the table below and in the example configuration above. |
| `save` | An optional `save` element defines a value to be saved after all commands have been executed. It has three mandatory attributes, where `type` specifies whether the value is to be saved as an operation property or as a metadata. The attribute `@name` defines the name of the process property or metadata type. The `@value` attribute determines the value, which can be a simple text value or a previously defined variable. It has two optional attributes, where `@choice` specifies which value should be saved if several are found, and `@overwrite` determines whether a previously created process property or a metadata of the same name should be reused. |


### Configurations within command blocks
The configuration within the command blocks is carried out as described here:

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filter` | This specifies which parts of the JSON response should be used to search for the `target` values. It has four attributes, where `@key` and `@value` are mandatory, while `@fallback` and `@alt` are optional. Further details can be found in the comments in the sample configuration. |
| `target` | This specifies which values are to be saved as variables for later use. The parameter has two attributes, where `@var` specifies the variable name and `@path` specifies the JSON path to retrieve the values. |
| `parameter` | A parameter is specified here that is to be sent to the REST API together with a request. It has two attributes, where `@name` is used for the parameter name and `@value` for the parameter value, which can consist exclusively of pure text values. |
| `body` | The request body is defined here. It has three attributes, whereby one of `@src` and `@value` must be specified. If `@src` is set, `@wrapper` is also applicable. The file whose content is to be used as the request body is specified with `@src`, while `@value` specifies the value of a variable that has been received from previous commands. When using `@wrapper`, it is advisable to consider the comments in the sample configuration.  |
| `update` | This element is used to save the JSON object of the response as a variable. It has an attribute `@var` that specifies the name of the variable. Each `command` tag can have at most one `update` sub-element. Within the `update` subelement, there can be multiple `entry` subelements, each of which specifies a change to the JSON response object. |
