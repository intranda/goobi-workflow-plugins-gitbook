## Introduction
This documentation describes the installation, configuration and use of a plugin for automatically changing workflows at runtime. The plugin can open, close or deactivate (depending on configuration) steps. User groups can be assigned and production templates can also be completely exchanged. The decision as to what exactly should happen in each case is made on the basis of process properties.


## Installation
To use the plugin, it must be copied to the following location:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/step/plugin_intranda_step_changeWorkflow-base.jar
```

The configuration of the plugin is expected under the following path:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/config/plugin_intranda_step_changeWorkflow.xml
```



## Overview and functionality
After the plugin has been installed and configured, it can be configured in the user interface in a workflow step. Make sure that the name of the step is the same as in the configuration file. In addition, a check mark should be set for `Automatic task`.

## Configuration
The following is a sample configuration with comments:

```xml
<config_plugin>
    <!--
        order of configuration is: 
        1.) project name and step name matches 
        2.) step name matches and project is * 
        3.) project name matches and step name is * 
        4.) project name and step name are * 
    -->

    <config>
        <!-- which projects to use for (can be more then one, otherwise use *) -->
        <project>Register</project>

        <!-- multiple changes can be done within one configuration rule; simply add another 'change' element with other properties here -->
        <change>

        </change>
    </config>
</config_plugin>
```

Each `config` block is responsible for a certain project and a certain step, whereby wildcards `*` and multiple answers of processes or steps are also possible. If a step in the workflow is executed with this plugin, the system searches for a `config` block that matches the currently opened step. For example, if in the project "PDF Digitization" the step with the title "Change workflow after PDF extraction" is configured and executed with this plugin, the plugin looks for a `config` block that looks like this:

```xml
<config>
    <project>PDF Digitization</project>
    <step>Change workflow after PDF extraction</step>
    [...]
</config>
```

In each `<change>` element it is then configured which process property is checked (`<propertyName>`) and which value is expected (`<propertyValue>`). Please note that the specification for defining which property is to be used for checking a value must be specified with the syntax for the so-called variable replacer. Accordingly, when defining the field to be checked, the specification must be as in the following examples:

```xml
<propertyName>{process.ABC}</propertyName>
<propertyName>{{meta.ABC}}</propertyName>
<propertyName>{meta.topstruct.ABC}</propertyName>
<propertyName>{meta.firstchild.ABC}</propertyName>
<propertyName>{db_meta.ABC}</propertyName>
```

Further explanations about the use of variables can be found here:

[https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-workflow-en/manager/8](https://docs.goobi.io/goobi-workflow-en/manager/8)

After defining how the properties are to be evaluated, the action to be performed is determined. The following possibilities exist here:


### Changing the status of workflow steps.
Depending on existing properties, the status of defined steps within the workflow can be changed automatically. Workflow steps can be opened `type="open"`, deactivated `type="deactivate"`, closed `type="close"` or locked `type="lock"`.

```xml
<steps type="open">
    <title>Create derivates</title>
    <title>Jpeg 2000 generation and validation</title>
</steps>
<steps type="deactivate">
    <title>Rename files</title>
</steps>
<steps type="close">
    <title>Upload raw tiffs to uploaddirectory Socrates</title>
    <title>Automatic pagination</title>
</steps>
<steps type="lock">
    <title>Create METS file</title>
    <title>Ingest into DigiTool</title>
</steps>
```

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `type` | Determine which status the workflow steps are to receive. |
| `title` | Define here the name of the workflow steps that are to be set to the desired status. |


### Changing the priority of workflow steps.
Depending on existing properties, the priority of defined steps within the workflow can be changed automatically. Possible choices for priority are Standard `value="0"`, Priority `value="1"`, High priority `value="2"`, Highest priority `value="3"` or Correction `value="10"`. If any `title` is configured with `*`, then its priority value will be applied to all steps of this process. If more than two `title`s are configured with `*`, then only the value of the first one in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 10 will be used.

```xml
<priority value="0">
    <title>Some standard step</title>
</priority>

<priority value="1">
    <title>Step of priority</title>
</priority>

<priority value="2">
    <title>Step of high priority</title>
</priority>

<priority value="3">
    <title>Step of highest priority</title>
    <title>another step of highest priority</title>
</priority>

<priority value="10">
    <title></title>
</priority>
```

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `value` | Determine which priority the workflow steps are to receive. |
| `title` | Define here the name of the workflow steps that are to be set to the desired priority. Use `*` if the value should be applied to all steps of this process. |


### Changing the responsibility of user groups for workflow steps
Depending on existing properties, the responsible user groups can be defined for several workflow steps. The configuration is done as shown here:

```xml
<usergroups step="Image QA">
    <usergroup>Administration</usergroup>
    <usergroup>AutomaticTasks</usergroup>
</usergroups>
```

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `step` | Determine for which workflow step you want to enter the user groups. |
| `usergroup` | Define here the name of the user group that is to be entered as responsible for the configured step. |


### Changing the process template on which the process is based
With a configuration like the following example, the process template can be exchanged while the workflow is running. Depending on existing properties, a workflow can thus be replaced by another workflow during execution. Workflow steps that are also present in the new workflow are automatically set to the correct status.

```xml
 <workflow>Manuscript workflow</workflow>
```

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `workflow` | Define here the name of the process template to be used for the process. |
