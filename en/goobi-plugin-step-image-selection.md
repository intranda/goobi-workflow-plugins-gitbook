## Introduction
This plugin is used for the visual selection of images. It allows you to select, deselect and sort the selected images using drag & drop.


## Installation
To use the plugin, these two files must be copied to the following locations: ​

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/step/plugin_intranda_step_image_selection-base.jar
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/GUI/plugin_intranda_step_image_selection-gui.jar
```

​The configuration of the plugin takes place within its configuration file `plugin_intranda_step_image_selection.xml`. It is expected to be located under the following path: ​

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/config/plugin_intranda_step_image_selection.xml
```

## Overview and functionality
​To put the plugin into operation, it must be configured for one or more desired tasks in the workflow. This is done as shown in the following screenshot by selecting the `intranda_step_image_selection` plugin from the list of installed plugins. ​​

The plugin displays some images from the configured folder in the left-hand area. If you scroll down within the area, more images are loaded if there are more images available. If the mouse pointer is positioned over an image, an enlarged view of the image is displayed, which can be used to check the details of the image.

Images can be selected from the left-hand area using drag & drop. If the relative position for dropping is detected correctly, the newly selected image is inserted there, otherwise it is appended at the end. The selected images can be reorganised using drag & drop.

If the configured maximum number of selected images is reached or if an attempt is made to select the same image multiple times, the selection will not work.

Selected images can be deselected again using drag & drop. Simply drag the image from the right-hand box and drop it in the left-hand box. 

The relative position of a selected image can be swapped with its neighbour by clicking on the top or bottom half of the image. There are two exceptions without swapping: if you click on the top half of the first selected image, it will be appended to the end of the list; if you click on the bottom half of the last image, it will be moved to the beginning of the list. To move a selected image to the top of the list, you can also right-click on this image.

Please note that the save button must be clicked in order to save the information of the selected images within the process properties.

        <!-- if greater than max, then no selection is permitted -->
