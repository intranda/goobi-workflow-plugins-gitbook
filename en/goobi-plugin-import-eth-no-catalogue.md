## Introduction
This import plugin allows data to be imported without a previous catalogue query. It inserts data into the user interface that has previously been copied from an Excel file and where the columns are separated from each other using `TAB`.

## Installation
To be able to use the plugin, the following files must be installed:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/import/plugin-import-eth-no-catalogue-base.jar
/opt/digiverso/goobi/config/plugin_intranda_import_eth_no_catalogue.xml
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it can be accessed from the overview of production templates by using the second blue button next to the selected production template.

At this point, you can choose between two different areas of the plugin. You can choose whether you want to work with library objects (`plugin_import_eth_no_catalogue`) or archival objects (`plugin_import_eth_archival_objects`).

Once the desired plugin has been entered, a user interface is available in which the data to be imported can be selected or uploaded.

## Overview and functionality
After selecting the correct plugin, the data that is either available as TAB-separated CSV data or copied from an Excel file can be inserted into the ‘Data records’ field in the user interface. The data has the following structure:

### Plugin: plugin_import_eth_no_catalogue

#### Eight columns for cards
If eight columns are used, they have the following structure:

Spalte    | Metadata       | Explanation
----------|-----------------|-------------------------
`1`       | `Identifier`    | This is the mandatory specification of the identifier.
`2`       | `Signature`      | This is the mandatory signature information.
`3`       | `Collection`      | This is the mandatory information for the collection.
`4`       | `Date`         | This is the mandatory entry of the digitisation date.
`5`       | `Units`     | This is the mandatory specification of the units.
`6`       | `Scans`         | This is the mandatory information for the scans.
`7`       | `dpi`           | This is the mandatory information for the resolution.
`8`       | `Remarks`   | This is the mandatory information with comments.


#### Four columns for monographs and multi-volume works
If four columns are used, they have the following structure:

Column    | Metadata       | Explanation
----------|-----------------|-------------------------
`1`       | `MMS-ID`        | If this contains an underscore, a multi-volume work is created, otherwise a monograph. This is a mandatory entry.
`2`       | `Signature`     | This is a mandatory entry.
`3`       | `Collection`    | Specification of the collection to be assigned. This is a mandatory entry.
`4`       | `Title`         | This is an optional specification.


### Plugin: plugin_import_eth_archival_objects

#### Two columns for archive records
If two columns are used, they have the following structure:

Spalte    | Metadata       | Explanation
----------|----------------|-------------------------
`1`       | `Shelfmark`    | This is the mandatory shelfmark information.
`2`       | `Date`         | This is the mandatory entry of the digitisation date.


#### Drei Spalten für Archivalien in Boxen
Wenn drei Spalten verwendet werden, haben diese den folgenden Aufbau:

Spalte    | Metadatum       | Erläuterung
----------|-----------------|-------------------------
`1`       | `Box`           | This is the mandatory entry of the box number.
`2`       | `Shelfmark`           | This is the mandatory entry of the shelfmark.
`3`       | `Date`          | This is the mandatory entry of the digitisation date.


Immediately after inserting the data and clicking on ‘Save’, the creation of the processes starts without a catalogue being requested.


## Configuration
The plugin is configured in the file `plugin_intranda_import_eth_no_catalogue.xml` as shown here:

```xml
<config_plugin>
	<config>

		<!-- which workflow template shall be used -->
		<template>*</template>

		<!-- define if import shall use GoobiScript to run in the background -->
		<runAsGoobiScript>false</runAsGoobiScript>

	</config>
</config_plugin>

```

The following table contains a summary of the parameters and their descriptions:

Parameter               | Explanation
------------------------|------------------------------------
`template`              | This can be used to define which production template the respective `config` block should apply to. 
`runAsGoobiScript`      | This parameter can be used to specify whether the import should take place as GoobiScript in the background.
