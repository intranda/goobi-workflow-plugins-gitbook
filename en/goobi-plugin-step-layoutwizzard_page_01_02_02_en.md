The right area includes the display of the current image and a header area with some information about the image file. Most important here is the drop-down menu for selecting the orientation of the current page. Please note that changing the orientation also changes the orientation of all subsequent pages, according to the rules selected in the `page mode`.

In the header, you can also switch to the next and previous image, as well as the next or previous outlier.
